# FXSkins
A collection of new Skins for existing JavaFX controls. These Skins will add more functionality to the controls used in
your applications with almost no need to make changes to your application's code.

Maven Central.

The FXSkins-samples subproject has samples that you can run and check out how to use FXSkins.

The code is being tested against the latest LTS Java version, which is Java 11.

## Pull Requests (PR)
We welcome contributions via PR.  
Before submitting a PR please file an issue for prior discussion. This will avoid you wasting time with a PR that
might not be approved because, for instance, might be outside the intended scope of the project.

### Filing bugs
When filing bugs it's most often good practice to attach a small sample app (as small, simple and with the fewest lines of code as possible). This app when executed, should show the bug happening.  
The reason for this is the limited amount of resources and time I have and also because in the process of filing a bug, developers sometimes discover that the bug isn't in the library but somewhere else.   
Without a small example app the issue might be closed prematurely.

## Feedback request
Please send pictures of your application that is using FXSkins, or a site that shows your application. Or share it through Twitter (you can reference
me through my twitter handle @P_Duke if you'd like).   
This is very important for me to know how users are effectively using it and make adjustments accordingly to make FXSkins better. 
Also, and if you allow it, to showcase example uses.    
Seeing this library get used also always motivates me to keep working on it.
