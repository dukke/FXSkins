# FXSkins
A collection of new Skins for existing JavaFX controls. These Skins will add more functionality to the controls used in
your applications with almost no need to make changes to your application's code.

Maven Central.

## Pull Requests (PR)
We welcome contributions via PR.  
Before submitting a PR please file an issue for prior discussion. This will avoid you wasting time with a PR that
might not be approved because, for instance, might be outside the intended scope of the project.

## Feedback request
Please send pictures of your application that is using FXSkins, or a site that shows your application. Or share it through Twitter (you can reference
me through my twitter handle @P_Duke if you'd like).   
This is very important for me to know how users are effectively using it and make adjustments accordingly to make FXSkins better. 
Also, and if you allow it, to showcase example uses.    
Seeing this library get used also always motivates me to keep working on it.
